### 🚀 About Me

I'm an ambitious and passionate **computer science student** currently in my second year at [SUPINFO Lille](https://www.supinfo.com). My journey into coding began at the age of 14 with **Python**, and since then, I've expanded my skills across various programming languages and technologies.

I thrive on **complex challenges**, whether it's diving into low-level programming with **C/C++**, exploring the capabilities of **Zig**, or tinkering with **Linux systems**. For me, coding isn't just problem-solving—it's a form of art.
